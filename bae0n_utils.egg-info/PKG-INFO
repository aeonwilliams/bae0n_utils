Description: # bae0n_utils
        
        Collection of utility functions to be used in Python. 
        
        ### ColoredText(r, g, b, text)
        #### ex: print(ColoredText(255, 0, 0, 'Hello World'))
        Displays colored text in the console.
            
        params:
        - r    - Value from 0-255 for Red
        - g    - Value from 0-255 for Green
        - b    - Value from 0-255 for Blue
        - text - Text to display with color
            
        Returns:
          Modified text string, now with the given color.      
        
        ### FitCellsToWindow
        #### ex: FitCellsToWindow()
        Fits Jupyter cells to window size.
        
        ### ActivateCellDoneSound
        #### ex: ActivateCellDoneSound(url='https://bigsoundbank.com/UPLOAD/mp3/0116.mp3')
        Plays a sound effect when a cell is complete. Currently kind of buggy with a failed cell.
        
        params:
        - url (optional) - url of the sound you want to play. Accepts .wav and .mp3
        
        ### ActivateCellFailSound
        #### ex: ActivateCellFailSound()
        Plays a sound effect if the cell execution fails.
        
        ### ClearDir
        #### ex: ClearDir('./images')
        Removes all files from a directory.
            
        params:
        - path     - The source directory of the images to turn into a gif. Must include preceding ./, should not include ending /
        - safe_del - Prompts user input for confirmation if set to True.
                     Default Value: True
        
        ### MakeGif
        #### ex: MakeGif('./data', './', 'test', 100, 'jpg')
        Turns a directory of images into a gif.
            
        params:
        - source_dir - The source directory of the images to turn into a gif. Must include preceding ./
        - out_dir    - The directory to save the gif to. Must include preceding ./
        - gif_name   - The name of the gif. Do not include filetype.
        - duration   - Number of frames in the gif...I think.
        - file_type  - File extension for the images. Do not include preceding .
        
        ### CorrMatrixAnalysis
        Displays in depth analysis of the correlation between features. Currently only addresses correlation of dependent feature to independent features, but will be updated soon.
        
        params:
        - df          - The dataframe to analyze.
        - dep_feature - The dependent feature.
        
        #### example call:
        df = pd.read_csv('Iris.csv')
        
        CorrMatrixAnalysis(df, 'species')
        
        Example output:
        ```
        Features With High Correlation to diagnosis:
          -0.79  - concave points_worst
          -0.78  - perimeter_worst
          -0.78  - concave points_mean
          -0.78  - radius_worst
          -0.74  - perimeter_mean
          -0.73  - area_worst
          -0.73  - radius_mean
          -0.71  - area_mean
          
          Features With Moderate Correlation to diagnosis:
          -0.70  - concavity_mean
          -0.66  - concavity_worst
          -0.60  - compactness_mean
          -0.59  - compactness_worst
          -0.57  - radius_se
          -0.56  - perimeter_se
          -0.55  - area_se
        
          Features With No Correlation to diagnosis:
          -0.29  - compactness_se
          -0.25  - concavity_se
          -0.08  - fractal_dimension_se
            0.07  - smoothness_se
          -0.04  - id
            0.01  - fractal_dimension_mean
            0.01  - texture_se
            0.01  - symmetry_se
        ```
